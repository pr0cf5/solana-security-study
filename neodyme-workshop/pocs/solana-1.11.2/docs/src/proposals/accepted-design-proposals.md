title: Accepted Design Proposals
---

The following architectural proposals have been accepted by the Solana team,
but are not yet fully implemented.
The proposals may be implemented as described, implemented differently as
issues in the designs become evident, or not implemented at all.
If implemented, the proposal will be moved to
[Implemented Proposals](../implemented-proposals/implemented-proposals.md)
and the details will be added to relevant sections of the docs.
